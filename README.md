# e-devlet_Hacking

This project was implemented by cloning a fake login form screen. 
Our goal is to warn users and raise awareness to avoid malicious software. 
With the phishing method, many users are reached via fake mail using social engineering methods.
In the course of our work on this subject, we also took over the accounts of a few users and told them to be careful by informing them later.
Please note that such practices are criminal. Be wary of spyware.
Thank you.
